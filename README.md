Strong Password and Its Importance

Ever since the internet came into existence, it became important to maintain the confidentiality of data and digital accounts. To achieve that, passwords were introduced. But to anyone’s surprise, people who were unaware of the ethics of creating a strong and reliable password ended up paying the price — often by having their data stolen in breaches and cyber attacks. Nearly **billions of users lose their data** each year due to weak passwords.

## Simple Etiquettes for Creating a Strong Password

- Use passwords that vary in complexity.
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **symbols**, **numbers**, and vary the length (ideally **12–16 characters**).
- Avoid obvious combinations like `password123`, `abc123`, etc.
- **Never reuse** the same password across multiple services.
- Make sure your password is **easy to remember but hard to guess**.
- Use a **password manager** like **1Password**, **Bitwarden**, or **KeePass** to store and manage passwords securely.

## Password Strength Testing

To demonstrate password strength, I used a free online tool: [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com)

### Key Findings:
- Using **consecutive same character types** (like all uppercase or all numbers) reduces password strength.
- Using **only one type of character** makes passwords more vulnerable to **brute-force attacks**.
- **Longer passwords** significantly increase strength compared to shorter ones.

## Common Types of Password Attacks

| Attack Type            | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**        | Tries every possible password until the correct one is found. |
| **Dictionary Attack**  | Uses a list of common passwords like `123456`, `letmein`. |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Uses leaked username-password pairs from breaches across multiple sites. |
| **Phishing**           | Tricks users into giving away passwords via fake login pages or emails. |
| **Keylogging**         | Malware that records what you type, including passwords. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle**  | Intercepts data between you and a website to steal credentials. |

## Summary

**Password complexity greatly increases security** by making passwords harder to guess or crack using brute-force, dictionary, or credential stuffing attacks. Complex passwords are **long (12+ characters)** and include a mix of **uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols**, while avoiding common words or patterns. Weak passwords like `123456` or `password` can be cracked in seconds, while strong, random ones may take **trillions of years**. 

> In short: The more complex your password, the better your protection against modern cyber threats.
